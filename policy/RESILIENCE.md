# Researcher Resilience

Viewing scenes of destruction and graphic violence puts open-source researchers at risk of vicarious trauma. At Atlos, we’re working to mitigate some of these risks. Still, vicarious trauma is a real part of open source research, [even](https://gijn.org/2019/02/05/open-source-investigations-how-to-prevent-address-and-identify-vicarious-trauma/) among professionals taking stringent precautions. Understanding how to avoid and address trauma is essential to safe open source research. 

If you’re struggling with your mental health, seek out professional help and consider taking a break from open source research. 

## What You Can Do

This page is based on Gavin Rees of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma’s [“Handling Traumatic Imagery: Developing a Standard Operating Procedure.”](https://dartcenter.org/resources/handling-traumatic-imagery-developing-standard-operating-procedure) Our framework is inspired by Hannah Ellis’s [article](https://gijn.org/2019/02/05open-source-investigations-how-to-prevent-address-and-identify-vicarious-trauma/) on the same topic, which is structured in three sections: preventing, identifying, and addressing vicarious trauma. 

### Avoid Vicarious Trauma

Limit exposure to disturbing media:
- Follow the [Atlos Rules](https://github.com/milesmcc/atlos/blob/main/policy/RULES.md) and make sure to flag applicable media as containing “Graphic Violence” to help other researchers avoid unanticipated exposure. 
- Ask yourself if it’s necessary to view a disturbing video.
- Only view content you’re prepared to view.
- View media in grayscale and without sound unless absolutely necessary.
- Limit the frequency of your exposure to graphic media. Increased frequency of exposure has been [found](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2054270414533323) to predict several mental health disorders. 
- Reduce the [size](https://dartcenter.org/content/working-with-traumatic-imagery) of the media window—don’t view disturbing content fullscreen. 

Develop coping mechanisms:
- Build a strong support network.
- Practice self-care.

Transition definitively away from open source research. When you’re done with research for the day, or just taking a break, take steps to prevent spillover into other parts of your life. 
- Create a [“transition ritual,”](https://dartcenter.org/resources/handling-traumatic-imagery-developing-standard-operating-procedure#_ftn4) like a physical activity or visualization, to help compartmentalize your work time. 
- Play a game or do another distracting activity immediately after viewing distressing content. In a controlled environment, playing Tetris after viewing disturbing imagery [reduced](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4526368/) the frequency of intrusive thoughts. 


### Identify Vicarious Trauma

Emotional reactions to graphic or disturbing content are [normal](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Publications/OHCHR_BerkeleyProtocol.pdf) and are not a sign of weakness. Amnesty International [explains](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/02/how-activists-and-reporters-can-protect-themselves-from-secondary-trauma/) that "Common signs of vicarious trauma include experiencing lingering feelings of anger, rage and sadness. In some more extreme cases, intense exposure to such content can lead to anxiety, stress, burnout, and post-traumatic stress disorder.” [Deviations](https://dartcenter.org/resources/handling-traumatic-imagery-developing-standard-operating-procedure#_ftn4) from your normal routine or character may also be a sign of vicarious trauma. [Here’s](https://ovc.ojp.gov/program/vtt/what-is-vicarious-trauma#what-are-some-common-negative-reactions-to-vicarious-trauma) a more extensive list of possible symptoms.

### Address Vicarious Trauma

Consider seeking professional help from a healthcare or mental health provider. [Here](https://unitedgmh.org/mental-health-support) is a list of mental-health hotlines in countries with such services. If you’re struggling with your mental health, also consider taking a break from open source research.

## How Atlos Helps

We’ve built several features to help researchers avoid graphic media and limit its impact on their mental health. Media can be [especially impactful](http://eyewitnessmediahub.com/research/vicarious-trauma/findings/what-makes-eyewitness-media-traumatic-) when researchers aren’t expecting to be exposed to something disturbing, so Atlos helps reduce surprise exposures. Researchers can flag media as containing “Graphic Violence.” Atlos doesn’t display thumbnails or previews for graphic media, so researchers must actively decide to view graphic content. 

Professional open-source researchers [find](http://eyewitnessmediahub.com/research/vicarious-trauma/findings/what-makes-eyewitness-media-traumatic-) that the audio of graphic media is often more disturbing than the video. Watching videos without sound is a common [tactic](https://www.hhrjournal.org/2020/05/safer-viewing-a-study-of-secondary-trauma-mitigation-techniques-in-open-source-investigations/) in industry, so Atlos mutes all videos by default. 

Similarly, in a [study](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/HCOMP/article/view/5270/5122) of commercial content moderators, viewing potentially disturbing media in grayscale instead of color reduced its psychological impact. Drawing on this research and the practices of [other](https://dartcenter.org/resources/handling-traumatic-imagery-developing-standard-operating-procedure) [investigators](https://osintcurio.us/2020/06/08/vicarious-trauma-and-osint-a-practical-guide/), Atlos makes all media grayscale by default.
