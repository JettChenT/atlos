# Atlos Rules

These rules help us keep Atlos running smoothly. By using Atlos, you agree to follow these rules. Note that these rules exist in addition to our [Terms of Use](./TERMS_OF_USE.md).

## Relevance

Atlos helps open-source researchers collaborate to preserve the historical record. Only media related to conflict or other notable events relevant to the public interest is permitted.

Discussion must also stay on-topic and specific to the attached media. Comments must be civil; personal attacks are prohibited.

## Accuracy

Embody the spirit of open-source research: Every update must be supported by evidence. When possible, attach visual evidence to your comments.

Intentionally posting false or deceptive information is prohibited.

Posting information without scrutinizing its veracity to the best of your ability is prohibited.

You may not use Atlos to bias or deceptively influence others’ access to information or perception of events.

Atlos does not independently review the accuracy of information published by its users.

## Safety and Sensitivity

Open-source research covers active events that impact real people. Media relevant to Atlos’ mission may be disturbing, graphic, and/or endanger public safety.

### User Safety

Graphic media is unfortunately a part of open-source conflict research. Atlos hosts media that may be sensitive to user safety because we’ve deemed it in the long-term public interest. While Atlos takes several steps to protect user safety when handling this media, Atlos users must recognize the graphic nature of conflict. You may encounter upsetting material while using Atlos. To learn more about how to protect yourself from potential trauma, see [Researcher Resilience](https://www.notion.so/Researcher-Resilience-eba7e125e08d46619675d4a12183daae).

When users upload or encounter graphic media, they must flag it as such. This media includes depictions of graphic violence, including:

- Physical violence or fighting;
- Blood or other bodily fluids;
- Physical harm, including visible wounds; and
- Death.

Atlos obscures this content by default, so researchers don’t inadvertently view it.

### Public Safety

It is prohibited to post information that could endanger anyone unless you flag it as “Threatens Civilian Safety.” Such media permits the identification or location of civilians engaged in behavior that puts them at risk of retribution.

Atlos preserves this content but hides it from all viewers, including researchers, except the submitting user and our organizational partners.

### General Safety

Content, including media and discussion, that is harmful to user and public safety is prohibited. The following is already prohibited by the Atlos rules on Relevance, \*\*but is also prohibited out of safety concerns:

- Threatening, promoting, or glorifying violence, violent extremism, or terrorism
- Sexual abuse material and child sexual exploitation
- Harassment or abuse of anyone or any group
- Promotion of suicide or self-harm

## Privacy

You may not disclose people’s locations or private information or use Atlos to “dox,” stalk, or otherwise surveil anyone, including public officials.

You may not add media with nudity to Atlos.

## Enforcement

Atlos considers the severity of the infraction and past history of the user in responding to violations of the Atlos Rules. Responses include a warning, a temporary ban on activity, and permanent account suspension. Atlos has a zero-tolerance policy for violations of its Safety and Privacy rules.

## Intellectual Property

By using Atlos, you agree to license all content you create under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Note, however, that Atlos reserves the right to restrict who is able to access and interact with the Atlos platform.

## Looking Forward

Atlos is the product of the open source conflict research community. We expect to revise these rules as our platform, community, and norms change. We always encourage feedback and suggestions—contact us at contact@atlos.org.
