# Atlos Terms of Use

These Terms of Use are a derivative of "[Terms of Use](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use/en)" by the Wikimedia Foundation, available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License. You can view a history of the changes made to these terms [on GitHub](https://github.com/milesmcc/atlos/blame/main/policy/TERMS_OF_USE.md).

## About These Terms

Welcome to Atlos! Atlos is a project of Politiwatch, Inc. ("we" or "us").

To support our vibrant community, we provide the essential infrastructure and organizational framework for the construction of a catalog relevant to conflict and other notable events relevant to the public interest. We welcome you ("you" or the "user") as a researcher or contributor of the Atlos catalog. Before you participate, however, we ask that you please read and agree to the following Terms of Use ("Terms of Use").

Atlos is an open source platform for visual investigations. By using the Atlos platform (the "Platform" or "Project"), you agree to these terms. These terms do not apply to unofficial Atlos instances (e.g., those not managed hosted on the atlos.org domain), though the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) for the source code still applies.

## Overview

These Terms of Use tell you about our services at Atlos (provided by Politiwatch), our relationship to you as a user, and the rights and responsibilities that guide us both. Generally we do not contribute, monitor, or delete content (with the rare exception of policies like these Terms of Use or legal compliance for DMCA notices). This means that editorial control is in the hands of you and your fellow users who create and manage the content. We merely host this content.

The community — the network of users who are constantly building and using the Atlos catalog — are the principal means through which our mission is achieved. The community contributes to and helps govern our platform. The community undertakes the critical function of enforcing Atlos policies.

You are welcome to join as a researcher, contributor or editor, but you should follow the policies that govern Atlos. Because we are dedicated to making content freely accessible to a wide audience, we generally require that all content you contribute is available under a free license or in the public domain.

Please be aware that you are legally responsible for all of your contributions, edits, and re-use of Atlos content under the laws of the United States of America and other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content). This means it is important that you use caution when posting content. In light of this responsibility, we have some rules about what you cannot post, most of which is either for your own protection or for the protection of other users like yourself. Please keep in mind that the content we host is for general informational purposes only, so if you need expert advice for a particular question you should seek the help of a licensed or qualified professional. We also include other important notices and disclaimers, so please read these Terms of Use in their entirety.

## 1\. Our Services

Atlos acts only as a hosting service, maintaining the infrastructure and organizational framework that allows our users to build the Atlos catalog by contributing and editing content themselves. Because of our unique role, there are a couple of things you should be aware of when considering our relationship to you, the Atlos catalog, and the other users:

1.  We do not take an editorial role: Because Atlos is collaboratively edited, all of the content that we host is provided by users like yourself, and we do not take an editorial role. This means that we generally do not monitor or edit media, attributes, or updates, and we do not take any responsibility for this content. Similarly, we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services, and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content. Instead, we simply provide access to the content that your fellow users have contributed and edited.

2.  You are responsible for your own actions: You are legally responsible for your edits and contributions to Atlos, so for your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid contributing any content that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws. For clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of the United States of America. Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn editors and contributors that authorities may seek to apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content. Atlos (and Politiwatch) generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification.

## 2\. Privacy Policy

Because our services are used by people all over the world, personal information that we collect may be stored and processed in the United States of America or any other country in which we or our agents maintain facilities. By using our services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside your country.

## 3\. Content We Host

1.  You may find some material objectionable or erroneous: Because we provide a wide array of content that is produced or gathered by fellow users, you may encounter material that you find offensive, erroneous, misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise objectionable. We therefore ask that you use common sense and proper judgment when using our services.

2.  Our content is for general informational purposes only: Although we host a great deal of information, this content is presented for general informational purposes only. It should not be taken as professional, military, or legal advice. Please seek independent professional counseling from someone who is licensed or qualified in the applicable area in lieu of acting on any information, opinion, or advice contained on Atlos.

## 4\. Refraining from Certain Activities

The Atlos catalog only exists because of the vibrant community of users like you who collaborate to write, edit, and curate the content. We happily welcome your participation in this community. We encourage you to be civil and polite in your interactions with others in the community, to act in good faith, and to make edits and contributions aimed at furthering the mission of the shared project. To maintain a healthy community, we require all users to abide by the [Atlos Rules](https://github.com/milesmcc/atlos/blob/main/policy/RULES.md).

Certain activities, whether legal or illegal, may be harmful to other users and violate our rules, and some activities may also subject you to liability. Therefore, for your own protection and for that of other users, you may not engage in such activities on our sites. These activities include, but are not limited to:

- Engaging in automated uses of the site that are abusive or disruptive of the services and have not been approved by Atlos;

- Disrupting the services by placing an undue burden on Atlos or the networks or servers connected with Atlos;

- Disrupting the services by inundating Atlos with communications or other traffic that suggests no serious intent to use Atlos for its stated purpose;

- Knowingly accessing, tampering with, or using any of our non-public areas in our computer systems without authorization; and

- Probing, scanning, or testing the vulnerability of any of our technical systems or networks unless all the following conditions are met:

- such actions do not unduly abuse or disrupt our technical systems or networks;

- such actions are not for personal gain (except for credit for your work);

- you report any vulnerabilities to Atlos (contact@atlos.org); and

- you do not undertake such actions with malicious or destructive intent.

We reserve the right to exercise our enforcement discretion with respect to the above terms.

## 5\. Password Security

You are responsible for safeguarding your own password and should never disclose it to any third party.

## 6\. Licensing of Content

To further the Atlos mission, all users contributing to the Atlos catalog are required to grant broad permissions to the general public to re-distribute and re-use their contributions freely, so long as that use is properly attributed and the same freedom to re-use and re-distribute is granted to any derivative works. In keeping with our goal of providing free information to the widest possible audience, we require that when necessary all submitted content be licensed so that it is freely reusable by anyone who cares to access it.

You agree to the following licensing requirements:

- Text to which you hold the copyright: When you submit text to which you hold the copyright, you agree to license it under:

- [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) ("CC BY 4.0"), and

- [GNU Free Documentation License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html) ("GFDL") (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts).

(Re-users may comply with either license or both.)\
Please note that these licenses do allow commercial uses of your contributions, as long as such uses are compliant with the terms.

- Attribution: Attribution is an important part of these licenses. We consider it giving credit where credit is due -- to authors like yourself. When you contribute text, you agree to be attributed in any of the following fashions:

1.  Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the incident to which you contributed (since each incident has a feed that lists all contributors);

2.  Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions);

3.  Through a reference to Atlos

- Importing text: You may import text that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others, but in such case you warrant that the text is available under terms that are compatible with the CC BY 4.0 license ("CC BY"). Content available only under GFDL is not permissible.

  You agree that, if you import text under a CC BY license that requires attribution, you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion. It is sufficient to give attribution in an update, which is recorded in the incident feed, when importing the text. The attribution requirements are sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of the license), and there may be instances where the Atlos community decides that imported text cannot be used for that reason.

- Non-text media: Non-text media in the Atlos catalog are available under a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted re-use and re-distribution. When you contribute non-text media, you agree to contribute and attribute media: 1) under a license that permits its unrestricted re-use and re-distribution, 2) that is in the public domain, or 3) that falls under "fair use" doctrine.

- No revocation of license: Except as consistent with your license, you agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation of any license that you have granted under these Terms of Use for text content or non-text media contributed to Atlos, even if you terminate use of our services.

- Public domain content: Content that is in the public domain is welcome! It is important however that you confirm the public domain status of the content under the law of the United States of America. When you contribute content that is in the public domain, you warrant that the material is actually in the public domain, and you agree to label it appropriately.

- Re-use: Re-use of content that we host is welcome, though exceptions exist for content contributed under "fair use" or similar exemptions under copyright law. Any re-use must comply with the underlying license(s).\
  When you re-use or re-distribute content developed by the Atlos community, you agree to attribute the authors in any of the following fashions:

1.  Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are re-using (since each page has a feed that lists all authors and editors);

2.  Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions);

3.  Through a reference to Atlos

- If the text content was imported from another source, it is possible that the content is licensed under a compatible CC BY license but not GFDL (as described in "Importing text," above). In that case, you agree to comply with the compatible CC BY license and do not have the option to re-license it under GFDL. To determine the license that applies to the content that you seek to re-use or re-distribute, you should review the incident's feed and updates. In addition, please be aware that text that originated from external sources and was imported into Atlos may be under a license that attaches additional attribution requirements. Users agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements clearly. For any non-text media, you agree to comply with whatever license under which the work has been made available. When re-using any content that we host, you agree to comply with the relevant attribution requirements as they pertain to the underlying license or licenses.

- Modifications or additions to material that you re-use: When modifying or making additions to text that you have obtained from Atlos, you agree to license the modified or added content under CC BY 4.0 or later.\
  When modifying or making additions to any non-text media that you have obtained from Atlos, you agree to license the modified or added content in accordance with whatever license under which the work has been made available.\
  With both text content and non-text media, you agree to clearly indicate that the original work has been modified. For each copy or modified version that you distribute, you agree to include a licensing notice stating which license the work is released under, along with either a hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or a copy of the license itself.

Note, however, that Atlos reserves the right to restrict who is able to access and interact with the Atlos platform.

## 7\. DMCA Compliance

Atlos wants to ensure that the content that we host can be re-used by other users without fear of liability and that it is not infringing the proprietary rights of others. In fairness to our users, as well as to other creators and copyright holders, our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the formalities of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Pursuant to the DMCA, we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and network who are repeat infringers.

However, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good faith. In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper. If you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on Atlos without your permission, you may request that the content be removed under the DMCA. To make such a request, please email us at contact@atlos.org.

## 8\. Third-party Websites and Resources

You are solely responsible for your use of any third-party websites or resources. Although the Atlos catalog contains links to third-party websites and resources, we do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, or the related content, products, or services (including, without limitation, any viruses or other disabling features), nor do we have any obligation to monitor such third-party content.

## 9\. Management of Websites

The community has the primary role in enforcing Atlos policies. We rarely intervene in community decisions about policy and its enforcement. In an unusual case, the need may arise, or the community may ask us, to address an especially problematic user because of significant disturbance or dangerous behavior. In such cases, we reserve the right, but do not have the obligation to:

- Investigate your use of the service (a) to determine whether a violation of these Terms of Use, the Atlos Rules, or other applicable law or policy has occurred, or (b) to comply with any applicable law, legal process, or appropriate governmental request;

- Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues or respond to user support requests;

- Refuse, disable, or restrict access to the contribution of any user who violates these Terms of Use;

- Ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access for actions violating these Terms of Use, including repeat copyright infringement;

- Take legal action against users who violate these Terms of Use (including reports to law enforcement authorities); and

- Manage otherwise Atlos in a manner designed to facilitate their proper functioning and protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and our users, licensors, partners, and the public.

In the interests of our users and the Atlos catalog, in the extreme circumstance that any individual has had his or her account or access blocked under this provision, he or she is prohibited from creating or using another account on or seeking access to Atlos, unless we provide explicit permission.

The Atlos community and its members may also take action when so allowed by Atlos policies, including but not limited to warning, investigating, blocking, or banning users who violate those policies. You agree to comply with the final decisions of dispute resolution bodies that are established by the community; these decisions may include sanctions as set out by the Atlos Rules.

The blocking of an account or access or the banning of a user under this provision shall be in accordance with Section 11 of these Terms of Use.

## 10\. Resolutions and Project Policies

Atlos releases official policies from time to time. Some of these policies may be mandatory, and, when they are, you agree to abide by them as applicable.

## 11\. Termination

Though we hope you will stay and continue to contribute to Atlos, you can stop using our services any time. In certain (hopefully unlikely) circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the Atlos community or its members (as described in Section 10) to terminate part or all of our services, terminate these Terms of Use, block your account or access, or ban you as a user. If your account or access is blocked or otherwise terminated for any reason, your contributions will remain visible to other users (subject to applicable policies). In such circumstances, however, you may not be able to access your account or settings. We reserve the right to suspend or end the services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Even after your use and participation are banned, blocked or otherwise suspended, these Terms of Use will remain in effect with respect to relevant provisions, including Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-15, and 17.

## 13\. Disputes and Jurisdiction

We hope that no serious disagreements arise involving you, but, in the event there is a dispute, we encourage you to seek resolution through the dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by Atlos. If you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in New York County, New York. You also agree that the laws of the State of New York and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States of America will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal claim that might arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in New York County, New York, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of Use.

To ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these Terms of Use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred).

## 14\. Disclaimers

We do our best to serve researchers, but your use of our services is at your sole risk. We provide these services on an "as is" and "as available" basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We make no warranty that our services will meet your requirements, be safe, secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be secure.

We are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from our services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms of Use.

Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our services is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or communication maintained by the service. We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or without notice.

Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the types of disclaimers in this section, so they may not apply to you either in part or in full depending on the law.

## 15\. Limitation on Liability

We will not be liable to you or to any other party for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, regardless of whether we were advised of the possibility of such damage. In no event shall our liability exceed one thousand U.S. dollars (USD 1000.00) in aggregate. In the case that applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you, although our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

## 16\. Modifications to these Terms of Use

Just as the Atlos community's input is essential for the growth and maintenance of the Atlos catalog, we believe that community input is essential for these Terms of Use to properly serve our users. It is also essential for a fair contract. Therefore, we will provide these Terms of Use, as well as any substantial future revisions of these Terms of Use, to the community for comment at least five (5) days before the end of the comment period. For changes for legal or administrative reasons, to correct an inaccurate statement, or changes in response to community comments, we will provide at least three (3) days' notice.

Because it may be necessary to modify these Terms of Use from time to time, we will provide notice of such modifications and the opportunity to comment via the Atlos platform. However, we ask that you please periodically review the most up-to-date version of these Terms of Use. Your continued use of our services after the new Terms of Use become official following the notice and review period constitutes an acceptance of these Terms of Use on your part. For the protection of Atlos and other users like yourself, if you do not agree with our Terms of Use, you cannot use our services.

## 17\. Other Terms

These Terms of Use do not create an employment, agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship between you and us. If you have not signed a separate agreement with us, these Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and us. If there is any conflict between these Terms of Use and a signed written agreement between you and us, the signed agreement will control.

You agree that we may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms of Use, by email or postings on the Atlos website.

If in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these Terms of Use, it is not a waiver of that provision.

You understand that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by us, you have no expectation of compensation for any activity, contribution, or idea that you provide to us, the community, or the Atlos catalog.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these Terms of Use, we and you agree not to modify the applicable terms and requirements of any free license that is employed on Atlos when such free license is authorized by these Terms of Use.

If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is found unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and all other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect.

## Thank You!

We appreciate your taking the time to read these Terms of Use, and we are very happy to have you contributing to the Atlos catalog and using our services.
