# Security Policy

Atlos takes security extremely seriously. If you find a security vulnerability, please **do not** create a public GitHub issue. Instead, please email the details to <contact@atlos.org>. Together, we'll work to understand the scope of the issue and develop a patch.

Provided you follow the guidelines set out in our [Terms of Use](policy/TERMS_OF_USE.md) (in short, you report the vulnerabilities to us, don't disrupt our systems, and you don't have destructive intent), we will happily work with you â€” and we'll be very appreciative of your help.
